# frontend-nanodegree-knockout

DESCRIPTION 
-----------

A simple nanodegree project showing how to populate a webpage with dynamic data (i.e ajax requests and maps) using Ajax and a framework
such as knockoutjs. Using observables prevents the developer from having to update the DOM manually. 

CONTENTS
--------

 The folder contains all the required files to run the website - 
 
 An html file, 3 JS files (jQuery and 2 custom files)
 
HOW TO RUN
----------
 
 In order for the ajax requests to work you'll need to setup a working environment. I recommend intalling NPM follwed by servelr 
 
 Instruction can be found here https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node
 
 https://www.npmjs.com/package/servelr
 
 Once servelr is installed run the servelr within your terminal under the projects folder directory. 
 
 Open your browser and type localhost:3000 to access the webpage.
